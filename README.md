# OTP-Box-React
Created with CodeSandbox
Hey Everyone! This is just a routine practice application made by me after watching Akshay Saini video.
Very small project but you can learn may things like
1. useState
2. useEffect
3. useRef (most important learning)
4. onChange event
5. onKeyDown event(was good)
6. isNaN function
